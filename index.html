			<h3 style="text-align:center;">Media Consultant</h3>
			<p>
				Since 2002 Jonathan has worked with select authors and publishers to help advance particular book projects.  Many of the authors with whom Jonathan has worked have done substantive interviews for broadcast on shows like '60 Minutes' and on various NPR programs, as well as on a number of cable newscasts, and national morning programs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				At times Jonathan produced videos that correspond with an author's work. A particular favorite of his is the work done with Lincoln scholar James Swanson. 
				In 2006, Jonathan produced a video to support his book "Manhunt" about the period immediately following the assassination, and the search for the killers. The two  spoke in his Capitol Hill home, surrounded by a remarkable amount of Lincoln memorabilia, and one of a kind objects. The video represents a good day's discussion about Lincoln, about the characters in 'Manhunt', and about the materials in Swanson's collection.

			</p>
			<p>
				In 2010, Swanson produced a related book, which followed the 'Death Pageant' for Lincoln, along with the search for former Confederate President Jefferson Davis.  The video supporting this book, Bloody Crimes, was also filmed in Swanson's home, amidst a tapestry of Lincoln artifacts.

				Author Barbara Mertz has a number of publishing personas. Jonathan spoke with her about her work as Elizabeth Peters, the author of several mysteries surrounding Egyptology. Here is one of those chats: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/WilliamMorrow1#p/a/u/1/BEJ8MV55b9o">http://www.youtube.com/user/WilliamMorrow1#p/a/u/1/BEJ8MV55b9o</a>
