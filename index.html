								<p>At times Jonathan produced videos that correspond with an author's work. A particular favorite of his is the work done with Lincoln scholar James Swanson. In 2006, Jonathan produced a video to support his book "Manhunt" about the period immediately following the assassination, and the search for the killers. The two spoke in his Capitol Hill home, surrounded by a remarkable amount of Lincoln memorabilia, and one of a kind objects. The video represents a good day's discussion about Lincoln, about the characters in 'Manhunt', and about the materials in Swanson's collection.</p>
