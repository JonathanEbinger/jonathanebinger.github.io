								<p>At times Jonathan produced videos that correspond with an author's work. A particular favorite of his is the work done with Lincoln scholar James Swanson. In 2006, Jonathan produced a video to support his book "Manhunt" about the period immediately following the assassination, and the search for the killers. The two spoke in his Capitol Hill home, surrounded by a remarkable amount of Lincoln memorabilia, and one of a kind objects. The video represents a good day's discussion about Lincoln, about the characters in 'Manhunt', and about the materials in Swanson's collection.</p>

In 2010, Swanson produced a related book, which followed the 'Death Pageant' for Lincoln, along with the search for former Confederate President Jefferson Davis.  The video supporting this book, Bloody Crimes, was also filmed in Swanson's home, amidst a tapestry of Lincoln artifacts.</p>
